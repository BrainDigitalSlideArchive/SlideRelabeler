files with others.  The intended flow of the application is as follows:
1. Select an input directory of files to be deidentified containing whole slide images.
2. Open a CSV file containing a table of files to be deidentified.  The most critical column of the table is the filename 
will allow the application to match the files in the input directory with the files in the CSV file.
3. Select an output directory where the deidentified files will be saved.
4. Select process files and wait for the applicaiton to finish.
5. Click on the image thumbnail after processing to view the whole slide image and verify it was deidentified.
